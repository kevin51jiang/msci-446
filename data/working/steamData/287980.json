Your city starts with three stations. Draw routes between these stations to connect them with subway lines. Commuters travel along your lines to get around the city as fast as they can. Each station can only hold a handful of waiting commuters so your subway network will need to be well-designed to avoid delays.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/287980/extras/MM_SteamHeaderGIF02.gif?t=1643317266\" /><br>The city is growing.
